# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks you for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about new and exciting opportunities. As a front end engineer I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out via email and LinkedIn. Which means that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to know the level of seniority that you're looking for. 

Can you send the company name, job description and total compensation details for the role or roles that you're reaching out about? 

Just to let you know at this point in time I'm not intersted any position that requires an algorithm / leet code style coding test.

Thanks for reaching out, I appreciate it very much!
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
